# Menus
#### Menus right? Whats on yours ? Wait!! You have no clue? What will you have though? seems fvcked up... 

Ok am thing of a way where hotels/restaurants can jus share there menus online and clients access them stress free, 

The menus are lively editted with prices and discounted products among other goodies

users can order or preserve a dish or visit the place later knowing what they have on there plates first hand.

# Such a  Gem, I wont miss in my gadget.

Ok another geus? What if?
- We had multiple platform support
- Added perks like running on a TV with advertisment
- Next level ads for commercials like big restaurants.


I dont have to visit <code>xyx.food.com/menus</code> To get the full taste. Just another app that is more less a social media app that only markets hotel menus.

# "Way down we go then. Lets milestone this bitch and get over the fact we actually started the project.", <em>I whispered in my thoughts.</em>

### Backend
I was thinking of opting for a Saas tool but there is nothing wrong with just practising <b><em>golang</em> with <em>postgres</em> and all the goodies it comes with</b>

### Frontend
For the largest part of my coding am just a fan when it comes to Android frontend, I have no much web because <b>I hated learning a new Framework (Ajax, Fetch and the likes...) for making http requests.</em> But htmx is starting to give me a very different perspective because with only html I can still, poll APIS, replace DOM elements, this among other things, makes it feel <em>god Mode</em> when coding  frontend nowadays. 

## Cause then, when am not worrying about Ajax n sh!t, can I learn how to actually center a div.
